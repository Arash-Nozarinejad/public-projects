# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It involves the use of statistical techniques and mathematical models to analyze and interpret data, identify patterns, and make predictions or take actions based on the patterns discovered. :robot: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data to make predictions or classify new data. In unsupervised learning, models analyze unlabeled data to discover patterns and relationships without specific target variables. :memo: :bulb:
