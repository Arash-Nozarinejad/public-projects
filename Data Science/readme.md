# Data Science

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines various techniques, methods, and tools to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves the application of scientific methods, algorithms, and statistical models to analyze and interpret data to solve complex problems and make data-driven decisions. :bar_chart: :microscope:

Data science encompasses a range of tasks, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interpretation. It involves working with both structured and unstructured data from diverse sources such as databases, text documents, images, videos, and more. Data scientists use programming languages like Python, R, or SQL, along with libraries and frameworks, to process and analyze data efficiently. :computer: :file_folder: :mag:
